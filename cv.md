8kyu KATA from CODEWARS: Sum of positive
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20
Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

function positiveSum(arr) {
  pos = arr.filter(el => el>0);
  let total = 0;
  for (let i in pos) {
    total += pos[i];
  }
  return (total)? total :0;
